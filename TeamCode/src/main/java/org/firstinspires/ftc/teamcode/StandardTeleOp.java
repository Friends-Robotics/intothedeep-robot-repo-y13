/*
 * This OpMode illustrates how to use an external "hardware" class to modularize all the robot's sensors and actuators.
 * This approach is very efficient because the same hardware class can be used by all of your teleop and autonomous OpModes
 * without requiring many copy & paste operations.  Once you have defined and tested the hardware class with one OpMode,
 * it is instantly available to other OpModes.
 *
 * The real benefit of this approach is that as you tweak your robot hardware, you only need to make changes in ONE place (the Hardware Class).
 * So, to be effective you should put as much or your hardware setup and access code as possible in the hardware class.
 * Essentially anything you do with hardware in BOTH Teleop and Auto should likely go in the hardware class.
 *
 * The Hardware Class is created in a separate file, and then an "instance" of this class is created in each OpMode.
 * In order for the class to do typical OpMode things (like send telemetry data) it must be passed a reference to the
 * OpMode object when it's created, so it can access all core OpMode functions.  This is illustrated below.
 *
 * In this concept sample, the hardware class file is called RobotHardware.java and it must accompany this sample OpMode.
 * So, if you copy StandardTeleOp.java into TeamCode (using Android Studio or OnBotJava) then RobotHardware.java
 * must also be copied to the same location (maintaining its name).
 *
 * For comparison purposes, this sample and its accompanying hardware class duplicates the functionality of the
 * RobotTelopPOV_Linear OpMode.  It assumes three motors (left_drive, right_drive and arm) and two servos (left_hand and right_hand)
 *
 * View the RobotHardware.java class file for more details
 *
 *  Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 *  Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this OpMode to the Driver Station OpMode list
 *
 *  In OnBot Java, add a new OpMode, select this sample, and select TeleOp.
 *  Also add another new file named RobotHardware.java, select the sample with that name, and select Not an OpMode.
